# elm-ui-examples

This is a collection of tweaks, hacks, and examples that I've found helpful (or at least interesting), while building things with elm-ui.

Do you have some code that belongs here?  Contributions welcome.  Maybe some of these things will find their way into a more coherent form at some point.

# blinky fonts.

Using Element.Font.external results in blinky UI due to font reloading.

Here are a couple of ellies showing the blink problem and then fixing it by loading the font in the html.
